# There are configure knobs for making dhcpcd smaller (and less featureful):
#
#  --small
#  --disable-inet
#  --disable-inet6
#  --disable-auth
#  --disable-ipv4ll
#  --disable-dhcp6
#
# It's easy enough to add use flags for these, but until the need arises, we keep it simple.

# Busybox' ifup/down knows about dhcpcd, and, depending on
# configuration, may automatically call it. From
# networking/Config.src:
#
#   config FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_EXTERNAL_DHCP
#           bool "Support for external dhcp clients"
#           default n
#           depends on IFUPDOWN
#           help
#             This enables support for the external dhcp clients. Clients are
#             tried in the following order: dhcpcd, dhclient, pump and udhcpc.
#             Otherwise, if udhcpc applet is enabled, it is used.
#             Otherwise, ifup/ifdown will have no support for DHCP.
#
# So getting this right very much depends on distro configuration. All
# we can do is provide a sysvinit script which may not really be
# needed.
